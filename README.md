🎓 Analyzing Student Academic Performance Factors

Author: Hayley Hawkins
Course: STAT 650 – Regression Analysis
Date: November 2024

📘 Overview

This project explores factors that influence student academic performance using regression analysis. Using a Kaggle dataset of 6,607 observations and 20 variables, I examined how study habits, parental involvement, family income, and attendance affect exam performance.

Three regression techniques—Simple Linear, Multiple Linear, and Logistic Regression—were implemented to test three hypotheses on the determinants of exam success.
